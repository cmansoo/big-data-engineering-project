## project description

1. model selected: multiple linear regression
2. data prep: split train test
3. feature selection: use correlation between features. linear the larger the relationship, the feature should be selected for modeling. find the correlation between features and response variable. -> converted to an F score then to a p-value
4. (or laternatively you can do stepwise selection. try different combos and pick the one with the lowest p-value.)
5. loss function: mse ans RMSE, the lower the betteR? or higher?
6. does the regression model meet assumption?
